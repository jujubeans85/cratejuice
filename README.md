## Getting Started

### Production Application (cratejuice/)

The main production-ready application with full PWA support:

```bash
# Run the deployment preparation
./deploy.sh

# Or manually index tracks and test
cd cratejuice
./crate_run.sh
python3 tools/cjplay.py --surprise 12
```

#### Adding Music

```bash
# Add URLs to rip (YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.)
./addurl "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"

# Or start the overnight ripper
./cjrip
```

#### Local Development

Serve the production frontend locally:

```bash
cd cratejuice/v3/frontend/public
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

### Simple Starter Template (v3/)

A minimal example for learning - static HTML/CSS/JS frontend with optional Flask backend:

#### Frontend
```bash
cd v3/frontend
python -m http.server 8000
```

#### Backend (Optional)
```bash
cd v3/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Deployment

### Production Frontend (Netlify)

The main application deploys to Netlify from the `cratejuice/v3/frontend/public/` directory:

```bash
netlify deploy --prod --dir=cratejuice/v3/frontend/public
```

Configuration is in `netlify.toml` at the repository root.

### Optional Backend (Render)

The simple v3 backend starter can be deployed to Render if needed, though the production app is fully static and doesn't require it.
